This was the final project of my Harvard Pre-College Course: Mathematics of Data Science and Machine Learning(MATH P-12160). We were required to train our own neural network in groups of 3-4, 
utilizing our new found mathematical understanding of CNN's to compete with other groups for the highest training accuracy. 

The reason why my group ultimately yieled the highest training accuracy(best: 98%), was due to my proposed greyscale conversion strategy. By eliminating the "color variances", so getting rid of all the irrelevant rgb data,
significantly improved the neural networks capacity to solely identify the outlines of the images, and ultimately identify what image it is looking at. (Greyscale reduces these vector values from 0-255, to just being 0-1)
